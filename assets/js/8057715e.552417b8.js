The lookup replaces the previous group lookups-* namely groups-subnet, groups-role, groups-private, groups-location and groups-function. The data from these lookups have been copied to the Hosts & Subnets lookup, and the previous lookups marked as deprecated.

The module is intended for entities providing Network Operation Center or Security Operation Center services, e.g. telecommunications companies, the so-called shared service centers and IT integrators.

Each tenant has its own dedicated dashboard showing how the selected device works, what alerts it reports etc. From the Master Console level, we can also easily switch to the GUI of the tenant, as well as generate automatic, periodical reports in a PDF file and send it to companies in which the tenant is located.\nA device in tenant mode is similar to a standalone installation \u2013 an additional option it has is the ability to set the connection with a Master installation and the rules configuration in such a way that specific alerts are sent specifically to the Master. Notifications and metrics regarding the work status of the tenant are sent in a similar way.
