Both require routers that support BGP protocol and optionally FlowSpec feature. When FlowControl detects an attack, it sends a command to the edge router(s) of the organization to block the offending traffic. Depending on the feature used, this command can be a filtering rule to place in an internal FlowSpec table or regular route to inject in the routing table. Both mechanisms work in similar way as depicted on the Fig. 3.1.","sidebar":"version-1.6/docs"},"XND module/FlowControl XND Module":{"id":"XND module/FlowControl XND Module","title":"FlowControl XND Module","description":"Introduction to XND Module","sidebar":"version-1.6/docs"},"XND module/Performance":{"id":"XND module/Performance","title":"Performance","description":"DDoS attacks (Distributed Denial of Service) are currently among the most popular and most simple attacks used by cybercriminals.
