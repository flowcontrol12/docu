### ver. 2.3

- Added a new functionality called **User Scripts** which allows for automatic communication by POST json message with external systems using the **REST Client**. This allows for sending **Alerts** to external systems and applications![user_scripts](assets_07-Release%20notes/user_scripts.jpg)

- Added a new functionality of **Advanced Custom Aggregations**. Being an evolution of creating **Custom Aggregations**, the Advanced ones can be used to set a dynamic key field value and any metric for them. The Aggregations can subsequently be freely edited, duplicated, exported and deleted, coming together with a **new analyzer tool**

- Added a new functionality called the **Playground**. The User can now easily test the NQL queries, the looks and functioning of the search bar query, as well as the produced results. This can be achieved through plain NQL code written from scratch or with the examples provided here: https://documentation.sycope.com/NQL/NQL_examples.
