While we do our best to represent the data as fairly and accurately as possible (interal tests), your environment may experience different limits.

1. Raw estimate is that ~60k fps should generate around 300 GB/day.
2. In custom dashboard configurations we recommend to add (best performance) up to 12 widgets per single dashboard.
3. Software image has by default : 128GB System and 128GB Data plus default retention policy configured. Please modify those before any production installation.

## Probe hardware requirements 

Probe is available as a license for Virtual or Hardware Appliance. The performance of the Probe depends on the hardware resources. Please see below the requirements depends on the traffic through out to monitor: 

| Traffic           | < 100 Mbps | Between 100 Mbps and 1 Gbps | Between 1 and 10 Gbps | Above 10 Gbps     |
| ----------------- | ---------- | --------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| Flow Export Rate  | < 100 FPS  | < 1000 FPS                  | < 3000 FPS            | 3000+ FPS         |
| Active Flow Cache | Thousands  | Hundreds of Thousands       | A few Millions        | Tenth of Millions |
| CPU Type          | 2 cores    | 2 cores+                    | 4 cores+              | 8 cores+          |
| Memory            | 2 GB       | 2 GB+                       | 4-8 GB+               | 16 GB+            |
