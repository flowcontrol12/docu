**We require/recommend the following:**

- Set the active time-out setting for flows to 60 seconds (mandatory)
- Set the inactive time-out setting for flows to 15 seconds (mandatory)
- Synchronize devices with an NTP source (mandatory)
- Configure devices that support NetFlow with no aggregation. Sycope recommends that you configure Netflow with no sampling if possible
- Configure devices that support sFlow with the lowest possible sampling rate
- When you use NetFlow v5, make sure to add the *ip route-cache flow* (or appropriate) command for all active interfaces and VLANs (sub interfaces) in addition to the ones you regularly use. NetFlow v5 is typically ingress only, you can calculate egress only by aggregating ingress from the opposing interfaces.
- NetFlow v9 supports ingress and egress NetFlow. Sycope recommends *ip flow ingress* on all interfaces. Mixing ingress and egress on multiple interfaces and a single device is not recommended.

## Collector hardware requirements

The tables below are lists of required server hardware parameters for desired flow limits.

While we do our best to represent the data as fairly and accurately as possible (internal tests), your environment may experience different limits.

1. We conducted performance tests using the latest generation processors with clock speeds above 3.5 GHz.
2. In custom dashboard configurations, we recommend to add (best performance) up to 12 widgets per single dashboard.
3. Software image has by default: 128GB System and 128GB Data plus default retention policy configured. Please modify those before any production installation.

We have done our best to make the calculator as close as possible to the real environment, but you should remember that this is only an estimation. **Please use it with caution.**
