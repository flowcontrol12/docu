# Notifications

In this menu under `Bell icon` in top-right corner **[Notifications > View All]**, there is a table with notifications generated by the system about its condition, for example, free disk space and CPU load.

Using the button with three dots in the upper right corner, you can set your thresholds for CPU usage, MEMORY Usage, and HDD Usage.
