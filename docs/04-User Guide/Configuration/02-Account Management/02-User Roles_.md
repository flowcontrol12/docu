This menu [Configuration>Account Management>**User Roles**] can be used to manage users roles in the System.

A role is a set of permissions for actions available within the system  (example: create a widget, delete a Rule, view a Notification Table...). A role can be assigned to one or several users. One user can have one or several roles. Two roles are predefined in the system: `Administrator`, `User`.

For roles, permissions can be assigned to selected endpoints that are available in the Access column. The user can grant the following access rights:

- **Add**
- **Delete**
- **Edit**
- **View**

Example 1: To create a role that only views the list of Widgets, the role must have the View permission.

Example 2: To create a role that can edit Widgets, the role must have the Edit and View permissions
