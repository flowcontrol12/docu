A **Dashboard** is a visual representation of data designed for quick analysis of the network traffic data and for informational awareness.

**Dashboards** consist of **Widgets** â€“ objects with a graphical representation of specific data which can be added, edited, positioned, deleted or modified as you like. Sycope allows users to set up multiple **Dashboards**. 

**Dashboards** can be combined into **groups** depending on the user's needs while a single **Dashboard** can belong to multiple **groups**.

A number of **Dashboard groups** created by our specialists to implement selected troubleshooting scenarios have been built into the System. These Dashboard groups are available to the user right after the System installation.

**Dashboards** and **Dashboards groups**, both built-in and user-created, are available for use in the **[Dashboard]** menu.

In the top menu, there are the following options:
