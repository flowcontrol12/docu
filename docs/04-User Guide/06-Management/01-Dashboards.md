A **Dashboard** is a visual representation of data designed for quick analysis of the network traffic data and for informational awareness.

**Dashboards** consist of **Widgets** â€“ objects with a graphical representation of specific data which can be added, edited, positioned, deleted or modified as you like. Sycope allows users to set up multiple **Dashboards**. 

**Dashboards** can be combined into **groups** depending on the user's needs while a single **Dashboard** can belong to multiple **groups**.

**Dashboards/Dashboard groups** are created and edited in the menu (**Dashboard>Management>Dashboard**).
