**Example: Bookmark to Raw Data with a clientIP filter and time filter**

In addition to the filter, the **Bookmark** can store information about the period of time on which to operate a particular element of the System.  The procedure for creating **Bookmark** is the same as in the earlier example, only the time filter needs to be additionally completed.
