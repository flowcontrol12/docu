In this menu [Configuration>General Settings >**Notification**] there is the table with notifications generated by the system about its condition, for example: free disk space, CPU load.



Using the button with three dots in the upper right corner you can set your own thresholds for CPU usage, MEMORY Usage and HDD Usage.



<!--The Mark as ACK button is used to mark a notification that has been handled. The same effect is obtained by clicking on the check mark in the ACK column-->
