One of the most important components of the Sycope system is the Alarms module. This module allows the user to flexibly build Alarms based on a number of conditions and rules that operate on the data streams collected by the system.

Sycope includes several predefined alarms created by a team of cybersecurity experts . These rules can be used as a template from which you can create your own rules. You can also create rules on your own using the wizard.

In this menu [Alerts>**Alerts Table**] there is a table with a list of all the alarms that are included in the system. Within each Alarm is a column of fields which, depending on user preference, can be made visible. This are listed below.
