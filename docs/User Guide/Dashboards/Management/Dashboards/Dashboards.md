A Dashboard is simply a visual representation of data designed for quick analysis of the network traffic data and informational awareness.

Dashboards consist of widgets – an object with graphical representations of specific data, which can be added, edited, positioned, deleted or modified as you like. Sycope allows users to set up multiple dashboards.
