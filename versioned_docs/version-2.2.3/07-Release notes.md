### ver. 2.2.1

- Added Baseline (dynamic threshold) functionality that allows the user to compare the same metric/field at different time offsets on a single **Widget** to perform comparative analysis in different time windows.

  The first type of dynamic threshold is the **Reference point**. It shows a single value of a calculated metric for a period of time offset from the base metric as a horizontal line.

  The second one is the **Reference line** threshold. It works on the principle of time shifting, i.e., presenting both a series of metrics/base fields and a series of reference metrics on the same (selected in the widget configuration) time interval. Only the values for the reference metric are shifted by a certain period of time in the past.

- Added **Stream restriction** functionality allows the user to block access to source data to protect data. It is possible to restrict the user's access to any Data streams in the System.

  This is one of three levels of data access restriction that has been implemented in the system. The other two are **User role** (ability to restrict access to GUI elements) and **Exporter groups** (ability to limit access at the level of a single exporter).

- Added **Discovery Mode** functionality to flexibly add new fields to the system (raw data/aggregations) for dedicated analysis and presentation of data for your environment.

  You can add a **new field** to the system based on a Sycope unrecognized (out of the box) field within the NetFlow template. New fields are added to stream netflow. You can also create an **aggregation** on a field with default metrics attached. The new aggregation appears in the system like a new stream (data is collected from the moment you save the configuration).

- Added a new **Widget** type - **Threat Trajectory** - to increase the possibilities of graphical data presentation. The **Threat Trajectory Widget** shows threats on a timeline. It allows you to analyze threats in a so-called Time Line to trace how a particular host was attacked step by step. This significantly improves the analysis of security threats in the context of a specific attribute, such as an IP address.
