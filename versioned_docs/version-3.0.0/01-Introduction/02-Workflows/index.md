# Workflows

This section is designed to help you navigate the system with ease and boost your productivity. We have divided this part of the documentation in accordance to the types of activities that are performed during daily work with the system.

- **Navigation** - moving quickly between dashboards ensures that you can efficiently get to the information you are looking for. Sycope has several mechanisms that allow you to quickly get to any place in the system.

- **Data selection** - Usually, solving a problem requires looking at precisely selected data. In our system, we have implemented several ways to refine and narrow down the data presented.

- **Analysis** - We have made every effort to make our widgets as functional as possible. In this section, we will talk about the functionalities that will enable you to use Sycope to its full potential.

You will find comprehensive guides and tips on how to efficiently utilize various features of Sycope, including:

- **Navigation**: Using dashboard main entry point, navigating within groups, through related groups and dashboards, switching dashboards via drilldowns

- **Data selection**: Understanding the search bar, using filtering widgets, adding filters directly from widgets (tables and barcharts), narrowing time range based on range selection in time lines, refining filters

- **Analysis** – Interaction with timelines – baselines and data selection, looking what's behind a KPI, getting more in-depth information from widgets, using context menu for drilldowns

The goal is to equip you with the knowledge to fully leverage Sycope's capabilities, making your tasks easier and more efficient.
