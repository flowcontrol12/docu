# Dashboards


A **Dashboard** is a visual representation of data designed for quick analysis of the network traffic data and for informational awareness.

**Dashboards** consist of **Widgets** â€“ objects with a graphical representation of specific data which can be added, edited, positioned, deleted or modified as you like. The Sycope system allows users to set up multiple **Dashboards**. 

**Dashboards** can be combined into **groups** depending on the user's needs while a single **Dashboard** can belong to multiple **groups**.

A number of **Dashboard groups** created by our specialists to implement selected troubleshooting scenarios have been built into the System. These Dashboard groups are available to the user right after the System installation.

**Dashboards** and **Dashboards groups**, both built-in and user-created, are available for use in the **[Dashboards]** menu.

The initial view shows a list of built-in dashboards grouped by licenses. For more on this topic check the [Built-in-Content](/Introduction/Built-in-Content) in the Introduction section.

After clicking on **Full dashboards list** we go to a view of all dashboards that are available in the system in a table format.

In the top menu, there are the following options:

## Favorites

Clicking on a **Favourites** icon you can reduce the list of Dashboards/Dashboard groups and display only those marked as favorites. To add a Dashboard/Dashboard group to favorites, just click the ![image-20230918094601972](assets/image-20230918094601972.png)icon in the Dashboards table. The white-filled ![image-20230918094537202](assets/image-20230918094537202.png)icon indicates that the Dashboard or Dashboard group has been correctly added to favorites. 


## Dashboard Groups

Dashboards can be combined into Dashboard groups. The view in the table can be expanded to display all the dashboards located in the selected group.
