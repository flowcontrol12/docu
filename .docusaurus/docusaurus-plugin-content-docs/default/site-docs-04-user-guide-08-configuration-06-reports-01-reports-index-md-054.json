  "description": "This menu [Configuration > Reports] can be used to create reports. Reports in the system are built based on Dashboards. Still, it is necessary to define a filter for the report (Report filter - [Configuration > Reports > Report filters] tab) to specify the time range to be analyzed in the report. In addition to specifying a time range in the filter report, you can create advanced NQL expressions that operate on selected data streams.",
